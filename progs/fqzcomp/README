fqz_comp v4.6
=============

James Bonfield, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute 2011 - 2013.

This is the 4th variant of an experimental code to compress fastq
data.  It has a number of caveats.

1) The fastq must consist of [ACGTN], or [0123.]. Anything else is
considered as an "N" or ".".

2) Sequence and quality should be on one line only.

3) All bases called as N will be assumed to have quality 0. This can
   disagreements after decompression. Arguably this is a feature as
   how can you have anything other than zero confidence that "N" is
   the correct call?

Although the program usage and documentation refer to .fqz files, this
is not compatible with the previous two variants using that format
extension. (However the magic number has been amended to include the
appropriate format version code so they can detect which files are
which.)

It has been tested on Illumina, 454 data, PacBio and SOLiD data files.
However there may be specific caveats with this formats as some break
the assumptions listed above. See below for suggested compression
parameters for each machine type.


Usage
=====

The program reads from stdin and writes to stdout, so it can be used
as part of a pipeline. 

To compress:
    fastq_comp [options] < a.fasta > a.fqz

To uncompress
    fastq_comp -d < a.fqz > a.fasta

Additionally in v4.0 onwards it can read/write to files instead.

    fastq_comp -s5 -q3 a.fasta a.fqz
    fastq_comp -d a.fqz a.fasta


Options
=======

Compression options are as follows.

-s <level>
    Specifies the size of the sequence context. Increasing this will
    improve compression on large data sets, but each increment in
    level will quadruple the memory used by the sequence compression
    steps. Further more increasing it too high may harm compression on
    small files.

    Specifying a "+" after level will use two context sizes (eg -s5+);
    a small fixed size and the <level> specified. This greatly helps
    compression of small files and also slightly helps compression of
    larger files.

    Defaults to -s3.

-b
    Use both strands when updating sequence contexts. This has no
    memory issues, but it slows down the compression and has only a
    small gain in compression ratios. Off by default.

    Do not use this with SOLiD data files.

-e
    By default the sequence contexts use 8-bit counters for memory
    efficiency. This forces 16-bit counters. It has a very small gain
    in compression ratio, but doubles sequence compression memory usage.

-q <level>
    Specifies the degree of quality compression, with a value from -q1
    to -q3.

    -q1
        Uses the previous quality value and the maximum of the two
        previous to that as a context for predicting the next value.
        Combined this adds 12 bits of context.

    -q2
        In addition to -q1, this extends the context by adding a
        single bit to indicate if the 2nd and 3rd previous qualities
        are identical to each other, as well as using 3 bits of
        context for the running-delta. (A measure of how variable a
	string of quality values are.) This is the default level.

     -q3
        As per -q2, but also adds 4 bits worth of context holding the
        position each the sequence.

-Q <distance>
    Requests that quality values should be stored in an approximate
    fashion. This is a lossy compressor.

    All quality values are stored within +/- <distance> from their
    actual value, but not necessarily always the same distance.

    Defaults to -Q0 (lossless).

-n <level>
    Controls the name compression level, from -n1 to -n2.

    -n1 uses a very simple string based compressor that takes into
    account the previous byte on this name and the same byte position
    in the previous name, with some basic logic to try and keep
    current and previous names approximately in alignment.

    -n2 breaks the name down into tokens based on non alpha-numeric
    characters and attempts to encode using numeric deltas where
    appropriate. It typically compresses better on regular names
    produced by (for example) Illumina machines, but may behave poorly
    on other data. You should test which performs best for your data
    set.

    Defaults to -n2.

-P
    Disables all multi-threading. This has no impact on the data
    format produced.

    The default threading used is very minor, typically using under
    200% of cpu usage, and considerably less on high -s levels.


To uncompress, simply use -d. The compression parameters are saved in
the output file so the decompression program knows what options to
repeat during decompression.


Caveats
=======

The decompression may not perfectly match the original data. Sometimes
this can generate checksum failures too (intentionally), although
these can be glossed over by using -X on the decompressor.

Known issues are:

1) Names in the "+" line are ignored. Eg:

@SRR1234
ACGTACGTACGTGGGA
+SRR1234
%^$&^!*&((&*&&&&

becomes

@SRR1234
ACGTACGTACGTGGGA
+
%^$&^!*&((&*&&&&

(This does not generate a checksum failure.)

2) A strict policy is applied on the meaning of quality value 0.
Specifically any non-N base call must have a quality >0 and any N base
call must have a quality of 0. These rules are enforced during
compression, giving checksum failures on decompression. (Community
question: should I do the checksum after enforcing the rule to make
the changes silent?)

For example:

@SRR1234
ACGTACGTACGTNGGA
+SRR1234
^%%%$%%^!%%$$$"&

becomes

@SRR1234
ACGTACGTACGTNGGA
+SRR1234
^%%%$%%^"%%$!$"&

The quality for base 9 (A) has been changed from !(0) to "(1). The
quality for base 13(N) has been changed from $ to !(0).



Algorithms
==========

Many of the algorithms are derived from fqzcomp-3.0 and in turn from
fqzcomp-2.1, although the primary parsing code has been completely
rewritten since version 2. Each type of data gets encoded using its
own model.

Names are compared against the previous name, with a certain amount of
wobble to match up colons and spaces where the intervening text is of
different length (essentially a poor mans name alignment). This
essentially means the context for encoding a name symbol is the
character at the same position within the previous name. There is also
dedicated prefix and suffix matching to help speed up encoding and
reduce space further.

Sequences are converted into 2-bit values and the last N bases are
used as the context for encoding the next base. The length of this
context is the primary affect of changing the level with -s1 to -s9.
Note it is not expected that you will have sufficient memory to cope
with -s9. Practically going beyond -s6 may pose difficulties.

N bases are replaced with the most likely of A,C,G,T - whichever takes
the least space to encode - and are replaced by Ns during decoding by
noting that the quality is zero. (This is enforced.)

Qualities use an Order-2 model based on the previous two quality
values. This can be augmented (-q1) with an additional context holding
the approximate amount of variance along the sequence. By summing the
differences between each quality and the next we can arrive at a
figure indicating whether this sequence has smooth behaviour - a
gradual reduction in quality along the length of the read - or highly
variable behaviour with lots of dips in quality.

It was found that this delta summation had better discrimination of
quality distributions than purely the position along the
sequence. However on very large data sets the approximate position
along the sequence can also be added in to the context by specifying
-q3. Note that this uses memory memory and is slower.

Normally quality is encoded losslessly, but the -Q option permits
encoding approximate qualities. With -Q 2 we could encode quality 35
as 33, 34, 35, 36 or 37. We choose (with approximations for speed) the
quality value from that set which requires the fewest bits to encode
and emit that instead. This was found to be significantly better at
reducing storage volumes than simply degrading the quality into a
series of N-wide bins, while still closely approximating the shape of
a quality profile and preserving any dips and spikes.

The entropy encoding is based on a range coder taken from coders6c2
from http://ctxmodel.net/rem.pl?-37. This range coder was written by
Eugene Shelwien, but it looks probable that it derived from Dmitry
Subbotin's range coder in PPMd.  The modelling code is API compatible
with the copy from Eugene Shelwien's coders6c2 (which looks in turn to
be derived from Dmitry Shkarin's PPMd code), but the functions
themselves have been completely rewritten to better fit the stationary
probability models used in this data.


Platform recommendations
========================

Different platforms give very different profiles of qualities and
sequences. While all the compression parameters are valid, you may
find that attempting to overcompress gives no gains (or even
marginally harms compression) while still incurring additional CPU
time. The space/time tradeoff will therefore differ per platform.

Illumina: -n2 -s7+ -b -q3,   or for small files -n2 -s5 -q2

    The bulk of development was done against Illumina files as these
    were the test set for the SequenceSqueeze competition. It should
    work fine with the defaults.

454: -n1 -s7+ -b -q2, or -n1 -s5 -b -q2 for smaller filers

    Tested to work OK, but -n1 gives a better name compression ratio
    than -n2. (I have more work to do with -n2 it seems.)  For large
    files try "-n1 -s7+ -b -q3", with smaller -s for small files.

PacBio: -n2 -s4+ -q1,  or -n2 -s3 -q1 for smaller files

    Tested to work mostly fine, but various non-N bases get turned
    into Ns due to them having quality 0. Solution: replace quality 0
    by quality 1 to prevent this. (tr '!' '"') How to fix in this
    code?

    PacBIO doesn't compress too well due to significantly higher
    variability in the quality values (close to 3.7bit per).
    Increasing -q has no real gains and infact harms compression as it
    takes longer to train the model, so stick with -q1 for speed. Also
    high order sequence models do not do too well due to the high
    error rate. If you use a high -s, be sure to mix it with a low
    order model too by adding '+'.

SOLiD: -S -n2 -s5+ -q1

    SOLiD support is available in a rudamentary form. It is not
    auto-detected so you must currently specify -S when encoding. (The
    decoder does not need this option.)

    I do correctly deal with the latest NCBI SRA download format which
    has sequences starting with the last primer base [ACGT] followed
    by a series of [0123.] characters. The quality is one character
    shorter. Eg SRR402768 encodes and decodes correctly.

    However I have seen SOLiD fastq formats where the quality string
    includes a dummy character for the un-measured primer base, and
    also seen fastq files that have no primer base listed at all or
    have one listed at each end. These formats are not supported
    currently as I cannot find any definitive statement on what the
    SOLiD fastq format is. It appears to change with wind direction!

    In terms of compression, SOLiD quality values are far more
    variable and have only minor dependance on position or context. So
    -q1 is the most sensible option.

    At present the complementary strand detection has not been
    implemented for SOLiD, so do not use the -b parameter.


Changes between 4.5 and 4.6
===========================

(Compatible with 4.5 and 4.4)

- Cope with Fastq files containing windows style carriage-return
  newline rather than unix newline only.

- No longer generates checksum errors when encoding/decoding files
  containing data after the "+" line (eg the read name).


Changes between 4.4 and 4.5
===========================

- Bug fix to the arithmetic coder, which occasionally caused crashes.

- Now treats non IUPAC ambiguity codes as N.

- Improvements to reading/writing from pipes; flushing blocks when
  they're full (as we do from a file) rather than when the pipe stalls.


Changes between 4.3 and 4.4
===========================

- Improved memory prefetching, particularly of sequence models. This
  speeds up high order sequence encoding by 30-40%. Decoding speeds
  have only improved by less, but overall the program is around 20%
  faster.

- Adjusted the sequence model to use 20% less memory.

- Support for more SOLiD formats. We now cope with the primer base
  having a dummy quality (or not as the case may be). Standards? What
  are they?


Changes between 4.2 and 4.3
===========================

- Bug fix to name parsing containing long strings of numbers.

- Added -X option to ignore checksum failures (eg due to N vs !
  issues). It seems quite commmon to have broken fastq files with
  impossible quality values. Eg calling an A,C,G or T with quality 0
  (meaning it's 100% incorrect, so why call it?) or calling an N with
  a non-zero quality (meaning we believe the N call may actually be
  correct).

- Checksum failures now properly return a valid exit code.

- Basic support for SOLiD sequence files added. There appear to be
  multiple conflicting ideas of what SOLiD fastq files look like
  though so mileage may vary.

- Code tidyup of argument passing.


Changes between 4.1 and 4.2
===========================

- Using -Q<num> mode for approximate quality no longer causes checksum
  failures. (Although it now simply disables checksums.)

- Minor tweaks to -q2 quality contexts.


Changes between 4.0 and 4.1
===========================

- I have added a fast checksum system to spot any potential errors in
  decoding. It's still more likely that a corrupted file will yield a
  crash in the decompression code than emitting data that looks like
  valid fastq, but this is for safety.

- Further improvements to the sequence model (-s5 vs -s5+) by
  combining multiple models. This only really helps on small data
  sets.

- Completely reimplemented the various order-0 models upon which the
  other models are built. This was previous Eugene Shelwien's tidy up
  of code from Dmitry Shkarin's PPMd (I think).  This means the only
  code not entirely mine now is the rangecoder itself.

- Implemented a new name encoder, -n2. This is typically smaller than
  the old -n1 encoding on Illumina data, but has not been extensively
  tested on other naming schemes yet.

- Minor tweaks to the quality encoding on -q3.

- Improved reporting of results. It now reports how many bytes are
  taken up by sequences, qualities and names. (Sequence lengths are
  also stored, but not reported. They are typically tiny.)


Changes between 3.0 and 4.0
===========================

- There are no globals or static variables now. All data used by the
  fqz class is held internal to it. I still need to improve on the I/O
  mechanisms so it can compress and decompress blocks to memory rather
  than stdin/stdout, but this is most of the way there.

- Split -1 to -N compression levels into explicit -s and -q for
  sequence and quality compression metrics. Added a new quality
  compression level for large datasets where we use the position along
  sequence too. Default of -q2 was old behaviour. -q1 does less
  compression than before, but is faster.

- Added additional levels of sequence compression, up to -s9 if you
  have the memory.

- Changed from 16-bit to 8-bit counters for sequence compression by
  default. This is significant memory reduction and for some sizes a
  big speed up too if it makes the difference of in/out of cache.

  The -e option switches back to 16-bit mode.

- Reworking of the models. Sequence and binary models have been sped
  up considerably, exploiting their smaller alphabet. The more general
  purpose 8-bit and 7-bit variants are now one model controlled by
  templates for the alphabet size.


File format
===========

The format consists of a header and a series of data blocks. The size
of the data blocks is controlled by BLK_SIZE in the source code.
Increasing the size may give files that cannot be uncompressed with
existing fqzcomp builds.

The header has 8 bytes.

0: '.' (4 bytes of magic number)
1: 'f'
2: 'q'
3: 'z'

4: MAJOR_VERS (version numbers, encoded in the source)
5: MINOR_VERS

6: 4-bits -s level, 2 bits -q level, 2 bits -n level.
   (slevel<<0) | (qlevel << 4) | (nlevel << 6).

7: flags:
   bit 0: both_strands
   bit 1: extreme_seq (16-bit seq models)
   bit 2: multi_seq_model
   bit 3: SOLiD mode
   bits 4+ are reserved for future use, set to zero for now.

Additionally, if SOLiD mode is set, the first base type is appended to
the header (typically T), as this does not appear in the actual
quality strings. (Sometimes - NCBI seem to prefer it that way at least.)

Each block consists of a series of little endian 32-bit words followed
by the compressed data streams:

Byte	Value
 0- 3	Total compressed size of this block
 4- 7	32-bit checksum
 8-11	Uncompressed size
12-15	Number of sequences
16-19	Size of compressed length data
20-23	Size of compressed name data
24-27	Size of compressed seq data
28-31   Size of compressed qual data
32+	Length data
?	Name data
?	Seq data
?	Qual data

Each of the 4 blocks of data - length, name, seq and qualities - are
all compressed using their own range coders to permit compression
within independent threads if desired.


To do
=====

1) Investigate the impact of resetting the fqz class per block.
This simulates efficiency of allowing random access. What block size
is needed?  (Need to move rc from global to a parameter of the models.)

2) Once we reset compression per block, we can perform multi-threaded
compression.

Alternatively with 4 threads simply slice file into 4 and have a flag
to indicate block-continue vs block-reset.
